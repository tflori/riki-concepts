# Conceptual ideas for RÃ­ki community

## Project

Riki is a project to bring developers the idea near to design their own project structure and get a clear understanding
of what is reusable code and what not. The framework itself contains only a few classes and has no tight coupling to
other libraries that are recommended. There will be a skeleton project without any examples but in the guide it is also
recommended to start from an empty project.

## Goals of the community website

- example website for this framework
- documentation for this framework
- community base for this framework
 
## Target group definition

The main target group for this website are developers using this framework or plan to use this framework in the future.

A second target group could be project managers looking for advantages of this framework and websites that are using the
framework.

## Categories

- Blog: A blog with posts what is new in this framework and other things related to development with this framework.
- Guide: A book that describes how to start with a new project using this framework
- Documentation: The documentation of the framework in the latest stable version (somehow synced)
- Exchange: A forum similar to the concept of stack exchange
- Contribute: A guide how to contribute to this framework (static page)

## Homepage and UX concept

### Login

On the upper right side of the website there is always either a login or the information who is logged in and what he
got new (comments on answers/questions, reputation changes, direct messages).

### Header

The header is large and shows the large logo of the framework on the left side and the users profile image right with
two lines of information. When scrolled to `heightOfLargeHeader - heightOfSmallHeader` the small header gets visible.
This small header shows the small logo of the framework on the left side and the users profile icon with reputation and
basic information on the right side.

### Homepage

The homepage should show a brief description about the framework, a highlighted link how to get started (the guide) and
a list of teasers to the latest blog posts.

## Blog

- Blog posts can be written by contributors and users with high reputation (revised by a contributor)
- A Blog post can be up and down voted what brings reputation for the author
- A Blog post can get comments that also can be voted up and down
- Blog posts and comments are written in MarkDown and follow the same rules as github MarkDown
- The teaser is generated automatically but can be defined by the author as well

## Guide

- The guide is not only about using the framework
- The guide is structured as follows
  - to be continued...
- Each guide page can have comments with up and down voting
- The guide is written in github MarkDown as well
- The guide can be printed as a complete book
- The guide can be downloaded as epub

## Documentation

- The documentation of the latest stable version will be synchronized
- No comments here

## Exchange

- Like stack exchange up and down voting questions and answers but with github MarkDown
- Live search while writing questions to avoid duplicates
