## Homepage and UX concept

### Login

On the upper right side of the website there is always either a login or the information who is logged in and what he
got new (comments on answers/questions, reputation changes, direct messages).

### Header

The header is large and shows the large logo of the framework on the left side and the users profile image right with
two lines of information. When scrolled to `heightOfLargeHeader - heightOfSmallHeader` the small header gets visible.
This small header shows the small logo of the framework on the left side and the users profile icon with reuptation and
basic information on the right side.

### Homepage

The homepage should show a brief description about the framework, a highlighted link how to get startet (the guide) and
a list of teasers to the latest blog posts.

## Blog

Blog posts can be written by contributors and users with high reputation (revised by a contributor). A blog post can be
 up and down voted what brings reputation for the author.

A blog post can get comments that also can be voted up and down.
